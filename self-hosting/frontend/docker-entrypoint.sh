# whole API 502s / times out until the frontend is manually restarted. To make
# nginx re-resolve at runtime we emit a `resolver` (the container's own DNS
# server, read from /etc/resolv.conf) plus a `$bt_backend` variable, and every
# proxy_pass below targets that variable. Sorted first (`00-`) so the resolver
# and variable exist before the location includes that use them. Only emitted
# in same-origin mode (BACKEND_URL set); cross-origin builds skip it.

# --- MCP endpoint + OAuth discovery metadata --------------------------------

# from MCP_BASE_URL and so names this deployment. Split-domain deployments have
# no backend to proxy to here and serve the static mirrors baked into
# /app/.well-known/ instead. The mirrors ship with the hosted deployment's
# URLs, so when MCP_BASE_URL is set they are rewritten to it — otherwise a
